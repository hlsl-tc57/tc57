# Contributing to HLSL

Contributions to HLSL and TC57 are expected to follow our [Code of
Conduct](docs/CodeOfConduct.md).

If you are not an Ecma member, any non-trivial contributions require signing a
legal agreement with Ecma. See the section [Required Legal
Agreements](#required-legal-agreements) below for details.

## Making Contributions

TC57 uses GitHub issues and pull requests to track our ongoing work. Filing
issues for feature requests or identified defects is encouraged. Pull requests
to address minor defects are also welcome.

For larger non-trivial changes please review the [process
documentation](/docs/Process.md) before making contributions.

## Required legal agreements

People associated with Ecma member organizations have a legal agreement in place
with Ecma to ensure that intellectual property rights (IPR) of their
contributions are appropriately licensed to be available to all ECMAScript
programmers and implementers. For non-members to contribute, you are required to
make these rights available by signing a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) for
non-trivial contributions.

If you wish to submit a proposal or make a significant PR, and you are not a
representative of a TC57 member, please register as a TC57 Royalty Free Task
Group (RFTG) contributor.

Ecma TC57 accepts contributions from non-member individuals who have accepted
the TC57 copyright and patent policies. Currently all HLSL related
technical work is done by the TC57 RFTG, for which the following IPR policies apply:

* [Ecma International RF Patent Policy](https://ecma-international.org/memento/Policies/Ecma_Royalty-Free_Patent_Policy_Extension_Option.htm)
* [Ecma International Software Copyright
  Policy](https://ecma-international.org/memento/Policies/Ecma_Policy_on_Submission_Inclusion_and_Licensing_of_Software.htm)
