TC57 holds regular teleconferences to discuss and make progress on active
proposals and defects.

All meetings of TC57 are covered by the [Code of
Conduct](/docs/CodeOfConduct.md).

## Agenda and Format

Meeting minutes will be posted into the [Meeting
Minutes](docs/DesignMeetingMinutes).

The first agenda item for each meeting is to approve the meeting minutes from
the last meeting and merge them into the repository.

The agenda for the next meeting will be posted in a pull request at the
conclusion of each meeting. Topics may be added to the agenda by proposing edits
to the draft agenda pull request replacing `<placeholder topics>` which appear
in the [template](/docs/MeetingMinutes/Template.md).

## Consensus Decision-Making

TC57 uses consensus decision making for all decisions. A single participant
breaking consensus can prevent a proposal or change from advancing. A
participant should not break consent without strong reasoning and willingness to
put effort into the process to resolve the issues.

It is acceptable and appropriate for participants to clearly state their dislike
of a proposal or solution without breaking consent (e.g. "I don't like this
proposal, for _reasons_, but will not break consensus."). Providing this kind of
feedback can highlight significant issues and allow proposal authors the
opportunity to address concerns. Candid and comprehensive constructive feedback
is essential to reaching the high quality bar we strive for.
