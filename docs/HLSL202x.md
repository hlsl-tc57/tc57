title: HLSL 202x
---

HLSL 202x is the working name for the first Ecma standard draft for HLSL.

The primary goal of HLSL 202x is to define a regular and consistent set of
behaviors and semantics to enable implementations to align on a common language
definition.

HLSL 202x should provide a high level of source compatibility with existing
implementations but may seek to deviate to avoid obvious defects or
implementation complexity. When deviating from existing implementations HLSL
202x will prefer alignment with C and C++ to leverage familiarity with users.
