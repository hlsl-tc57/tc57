title: Committee Process
---

TC57 conducts its work through two main processes,
[defects](/docs/DefectProcess.md) and [proposals](/docs/ProposalProcess.md).

The defect process handles specification errors, omissions or other gaps.
This is also the primary process used for filling out specification language in
the draft standard as we work toward our initial specification. Specification
language introduced through the defect process must be consistent with at least
one existing implementation of HLSL.

The proposal process handles changes in language behavior from existing
implementations and introduction of new features.

TC57 holds regular teleconferences during which the defect and proposal
processes operate.
