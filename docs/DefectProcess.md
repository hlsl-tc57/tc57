title: Defect Process
---

The TC57 defect process allows is streamlined process for correcting
specification text or filling specification gaps. This is the primary process by
which the specification is edited.

Changes introduced through the defect process must align with the behavior of an
implementation, and should not seek to change behavior. Changes in behavior
should follow the [proposal process](/docs/ProposalProcess.md).

## Reporting a Defect

TC57 tracks defects using GitHub Issues. New defects may be filed with the
[defect
template](https://github.com/llvm-beanz/tc/issues/new?template=defect.md) on
this repository. When filing a defect report please include all relevant
context.

## Fixing a Defect

TC57 uses GitHub pull requests as the only method for integrating changes to the
specification. All defect fixes must be submitted as pull requests and reviewed
by a member of TC57.
