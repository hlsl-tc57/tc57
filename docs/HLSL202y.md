title: HLSL 202y
---

HLSL 202y is the working name for the feature release following HLSL 202x.

The primary goal of HLSL 202y is to bring new language features and requested
improvements to HLSL. Two main areas of focus for HLSL 202y are modern C++
compatibility, and reduction of undefined and unspecified behavior.

While HLSL 202x seeks to have a high degree of source compatibility with
existing implementations, HLSL 202y will allow more source breaking changes to
enable moving the language forward.
