## Provisional Management

The Executive Committee nominated a provisional chair and vice chair at the
October 2025 meeting. According to Ecma's rules these individuals will serve a
term of no less than 6 months.

Provisional Chair: Chris Bieneman (@llvm-beanz)
Provisional Vice-Chair: Farzon Lotfi (@farzonl)

## Chair Group

At the first meeting of the Technical Committee after the initial period new
chair(s) will be elected by TC57 via consensus. Since chairs must be elected
on a specified schedule, a vote of Ecma members will be used if consensus is not
reached.

### Responsibilities of the Chairs

The chair group facilitates operations of TC57. The chairs may distribute and
delegate responsibilities as necessary.

* Finalizing meeting agendas and managing meeting schedules.
* Facilitating meeting flow and ensuring necessary prioritization.
* Conducting the [processes](/docs/Process.md) of TC57, and keeping up-to-date
  process documentation.
* Administering communication and operational services (GitHub, chat, etc).
* Calling for consensus and noting dissent.
* Ensuring accurate and timely preparation of meeting minutes.
* Coordinating with Ecma.

## Editor Group

TC57 shall annually select a set of volunteers to serve as editors.

Editors are responsible for facilitating the [defect
process](/docs/DefectProcess.md). A core responsibility of editors is to
determine if an issue or pull request addressing a defect is actually a defect
or a behavioral change that should go through the [proposal
process](/docs/ProposalProcess.md).

The Editor Group will provide an update at each meeting of the TC summarizing
the editorial changes made between meetings of the TC, and highlighting any
areas of interest that may warrant wider discussion.

## Designated Liaisons

TC57 shall annually select a set of volunteers to serve as liaisons to related
entities outside TC57. These bodies may be standardization bodies, industry
consortiums, open-source communities, or other implementer or user forums.

Suggested liaisons:
* The Khronos Group - Vulkan Working Group
* The Khronos Group - SPIR-V Working Group
* W3C - GPU for the Web (WebGPU)
